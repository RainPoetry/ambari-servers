		Tells Sentinel to monitor this master, and to consider it in O_DOWN
		(Objectively Down) state only if at least quorum sentinels agree.
		
		Note that whatever is the ODOWN quorum, a Sentinel will require to
		be elected by the majority of the known Sentinels in order to
		start a failover, so no failover can be performed in minority.
		
		Note: master name should not include special characters or spaces.
		The valid charset is A_z 0_9 and the three characters ".__".

		Down).
		
		Default is 30 seconds.

		How many slaves we can reconfigure to point to the new slave simultaneously
		during the failover. Use a low number if you use the slaves to serve query
		to avoid that all the slaves will be unreachable at about the same
		time while performing the synchronization with the master.
